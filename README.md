# Rocket League OBS Display Plugin

This is a plugin for OBS to display your current Rocket League form, it switches between images based on wins/losses. 

## Instructions

Requires [bakkesmod](http://bakkesmod.com/)

Download the rl-form.lua file onto the computer running OBS, and then within OBS open "Tools->Scripts". Under the "Scripts" tab, hit the + symbol 
and point it to the downloaded file. 

In OBS, you'll need to setup an image source, which you can then select in the script settings. Also, you will need to set up the images for the different forms,
from worst to best in ascending order. You will also need to set up the path to the bakkesmod log file (typically something like 
C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/rocketleague/Binaries/Win32/bakkesmod/bakkesmod.log).
